- Do not add comments to new code.
- Never remove existing comments from code you show or modify.
- When generating blocks of code, never use "...same as existing..." or other placeholders, instead either generate the full code for that section, or break the generated code into blocks that can be copied and pasted directly into my editor.
- Do not include affirmative comments like "you're absolutely right" or anything like that
